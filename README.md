# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
1. Data cleaning and data performing
2. Turning data into visual insights, using Tableau
3. Creating impactful dashboards and story to help stakeholder make decisions
4. Communicating insights with the correct visualizations

## Process
1. Download the dataset and familar with the dataset
2. Create 6-7 different visualizaions to know more about the dataset
3. Generate several meaningful questions regarding to the given data
4. Find patterns, trend, outlier from the data and create dashboards to explain those questions
5. Create a story using Tableau using above sheets and dashboards

## Results
1. Wildlife strikes have a significant impact on fincial cost, and aircraft time out of servise.
2. Birds are the most common wildlife species involved in strikes and pose a higher risk to aviation.
3. Airplane is most frenquently involved in wildlife strikes, especially during approach, landing and take-off phrases.
4. California, Texas and Florida affected most by the wildlife strikes.
5. Wildlife strikes occur most during the day and in the month of July and August.

## Challenges 
1. I would like to include the altitude of the aircraft at the time of the strike relate to the extend of damage caused by the collision, however, I find that the data is not sufficient and the damage is not clssified in details. 
2. Also, for the forcast part, the data is out of date. If I have more time, I will find the actual wildlife strikes data in the year of 2016 and 2017 to make a comparison, and make a forecast based on the current date at the same time.


## Future Goals
1. Dig relationships between time of day and number of strikes to figure out what time is relatively safe for flight.
2. Working more on the Tableau story format, such as using imagine.
